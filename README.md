# **ðŸ“‚ STM32F446RE â€“ All My Projects & Work**

  Welcome to my STM32F446RE repository, a complete collection of all the projects, experiments, and embedded system applications Iâ€™ve built using the STM32F446RE microcontroller. This repo showcases my hands-on journey with the STM32 platform â€” from basic GPIO examples to practical applications.

  Whether you're here to learn, explore, or collaborate, this repository serves as a central hub for everything Iâ€™ve created with the STM32F446RE (ARM Cortex-M4) MCU.

ðŸ”§ All code is tested on the **Nucleo-F446RE board** and written using **STM32CubeIDE** with HAL drivers and **Keil IDE**.
